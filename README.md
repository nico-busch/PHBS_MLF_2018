## Description of Data
Our project makes use of two databases provided through the Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) platform.
- News data (Source: Ravenpack News Analytics) - provides real-time structured sentiment, relevance and novelty data for entities and events detected in the unstructured text published by reputable content sources.
- Market data (Source: Compustat Global) - provides active and inactive fundamental and market data on global securities
## Goal of the Project
Our project aims to build a model able to predict the movement of stock prices by analyzing the content of news data. In an evergrowing sea of information we want to determine and understand the data with the most predictive power.
